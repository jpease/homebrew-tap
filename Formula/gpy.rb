  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      GPY is installed, but Homebrew formulas don't modify your dotfiles.
      To wire it into the shell you use (Fish, Zsh or Bash), run:

        gpy setup

      It detects your shell from $SHELL; pass --shell fish|zsh|bash to pick
      another. Then restart your shell with `exec $SHELL`.
      Run 'gpy doctor' any time to check your setup.
